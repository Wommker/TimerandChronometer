# Chronometerandtimer
Timer and Chronometer in the same desktop application, select the time to make a timer, or start a timer from 0

When it reaches the second 0 as the timer plays a sound, it has an error that I cannot solve, if the application is minimized and the timer reaches 0 the sound is not played until the application is opened again, can you solve this error ?
